Project Summary
Prakriti is an intelligent agricultural advisory system aimed at supporting Indian farmers by providing contextual, multilingual advice on crops, pests, diseases, and farming practices. It leverages a Knowledge Graph integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to deliver real-time, localized information that enhances agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Project Module Description
Frontend: Developed with React, featuring a chat interface for user queries and a graph visualization of agricultural knowledge. The application now includes proper branding and enhanced UI components.
Backend: Built using FastAPI, it connects to a Neo4j database, processes queries, and manages real-time updates through an autonomous agent.
Knowledge Graph: Utilizes Neo4j to store and manage agricultural data, enabling structured querying.
RAG Pipeline: Combines structured data from the Knowledge Graph with unstructured data from FAISS for improved query responses.
